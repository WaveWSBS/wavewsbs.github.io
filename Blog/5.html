Cool now's everyone's happy<br>

It's just me, you and the music now, Slim<br>
I hope you hear it<br>
we're in a car right now<br>
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric<br>
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die<br>
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP<br>
Just to try to get people to buy<br>
Well how's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun<br>
Last album now 'cause after this you'll be officially done<br>
Eminem killed by M and M<br>
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials<br>
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it<br>
Since you're in love with your city so much<br>
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here<br>
Two more exits, time is quite near<br>
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear<br>
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea<br>
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror<br>
Oh God, police! Ah!<br>
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least<br>
New plan Stan<br>
Slim, "chauvinist pig drove in this big, Lincoln town car!"<br>
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you<br>
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, hope you can swim good!<br>
Now say you hate homos again!
