  <p>2020/07/28/1541<br>
    It didn't work<br>

    i saw a blog which is really amazing. and i love the graphics and the animation in it. <br>
    sadly i don't know how to use Javascript or any other fancy stuff like css or sth. (i don't even know what the hell css is! 我，不行！:*-() just plain html <br>
    but it is still super cool to look @ a page that is super fancy and and quiet clean 2 look @ <br>
    i'll not use those fancy tools to decorate
    i will try to move the blog 2 a independent page and will be an super link at the top @ of the page. <br>
    lot of funny thing happed in these days i am no active. i'll try 2 catch up the story with you(even though that i know the chance of sb reading this have the similar resault of tan90°(none)<br>
    well, peace!
