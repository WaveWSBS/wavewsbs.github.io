  i saw a blog which is really amazing. and i love the graphics and the animation in it. <br>
  sadly i don't know how to use Javascript or any other fancy stuff like css or sth. (i don't even know what the hell css is! 我，不行！:*-() just plain html <br>
  but it is still super cool to look @ a page that is super fancy and and quiet clean 2 look @ <br>
  i'll not use those fancy tools to decorate
  i will try to move the blog 2 a independent page and will be an super link at the top @ of the page. <br>

  well, peace!
